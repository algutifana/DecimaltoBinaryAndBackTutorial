# How to convert Binary to Decimal

1. Take the positional value of the binary number and multiply it by the digit
2. Add the values together


## Example

1. Convert 100101 to decimal
2. (1 times 2 to the 5th) + (0 times 2 to the 4th) + (0 times 2 to the 3rd) + (1 times 2 to the 2nd) + (0 times 2 to the 1st) + (1 times 1 to the power of 0)
3. The above calculation once added equals 37
4. Therefore, 100101 in decimal notation is 37.
